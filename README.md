# Project Data - Bike Sharing Analysis
🚴‍♀️ **About the Project:**

This project was created as part of completing the Dicoding certification class "Belajar Analisis Data dengan Python."

🎯 **Project Goal:**

Using the Bike Sharing Dataset from Kaggle, this project explores various data analysis techniques. It includes data wrangling (collecting, assessing, and cleaning data), performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to find valuable insights, and visualizing the data for easier understanding. Finally, the project concludes with building a dashboard using Python's Streamlit to present the findings interactively.
